### Description:
<p align="justify">
Our group was inspired by the idea of creating role-playing escape rooms together for our project. Role-playing escape room games engage players in the fun of solving puzzles in order to escape the room they are trapped in. Usually, escape rooms consist of multiple rooms and these rooms have themes that are central to the puzzles in each room. 
For our escape room, the aim of the game is to solve the puzzles or play mini-games in each room such that you are able to escape all the rooms eventually. This comprises a battle that requires players to battle Big Boss Chu Khan with all the items that they have collected in each of the rooms they were in before. Some other examples of the puzzles or mini-games that our game consists of involve timed quizzes, turn-based attack-and-defense games and even a room inspired by ‘Alien Isolation’, where the player needs to hide and eventually escape from the alien that will attack him or her. Health points, item storages, a scoreboard system and the greatly implemented turtle library are just some of the few features that our group has utilised while coding the game. The health points variable keeps track of the health of the player, and the player will pass away if the number of health points drops to 0. The item storage, also known as the player inventory, is a list in our python code, and allows the player to carry items that will come in handy for the final battle with Big Boss Chu Khan. In addition, the scoreboard will keep track of which player managed to end the game with the highest amount of health points. Last but not least, the turtle program shows the map which is needed for one of the minigames, and displays the arduous journey of the player and the turtle from one end of the room to the other.
